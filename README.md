# Blazor-WebAssembly-GraphQL

A full stack application using Blazor Wasm, SQL Server and GraphQL. 

# Configure the Strawberry Shake CLI tools

We need to configure the Strawberry Shake tool which will help us create a GraphQL client. Navigate to the `BlazorWithGraphQL\Client` directory in your machine, open a command prompt, and run the following command:

```
dotnet new tool-manifest
```

Upon successful execution, it will add a `.config` folder in the `BlazorWithGraphQL\Client` directory. This folder will contain a `dotnet-tools.json` file.

Run the following command in the command prompt to install the Strawberry Shake tools.

```
dotnet tool install StrawberryShake.Tools -â€“local
```
